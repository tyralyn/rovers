ASSUMPTIONS:

The following assumptions are made:

That two multiple rovers can occupy the same space/coordinate. 

That a rover will not fall off the edge of the plateau. It can be at the edge of the plateau, but will not fall off and will instead stay in the same place until a valid move (one that doesn't result in it falling off the plateau) is made. 

That a rover that does not start on the plateau will not be able to get on the plateau. A rover that does not start on the plateau will be ignored. 

As mentioned in the project description, the rovers are moved sequentially.
